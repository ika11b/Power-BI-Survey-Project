# Power-BI-Survey-Project

Welcome to the Power BI Survey Project repository.

The main objective of this project is to build an interactive Power BI dashboard that analyzes the survey responses of data professionals based on various factors such as:

• Survey Takers Amount and Average Age
• Country of Residence  
• Average Salary by each Job 
• Favorite Programming Language by Job Role  
• Difficulty of Breaking into the Data Industry  
• Happiness with Work-Life Balance and Salary  

During this project, I applied the following Power BI skills:

• Data Cleaning (Removing Unnecessary Columns, Data binning)
• Creating Custom DAX Measures (Calculating Average Salary for Binned Categories)  
• Creating Interactive Visuals (Bar Charts, Donut Charts, Tree Maps, Gauge Charts)  
• Designing a Clean and Insightful Report Layout
